The CommunityEngineServer image provides an Amazon EC2 instance (based on the Rightscale Ubuntu AMI), with all the prerequisites for a CommunityEngine application.

The ce_setup.rb script can be used to setup an EC2 instance with a CE application, or it can be used on your local machine to get your CE application installed (tested on OS X only so far).

## Using CommunityEngine-Setup with EC2, using a CommunityEngineServer instance:

You should get familiar with the process for launching an EC2 instance in general:
  http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/2008-05-05/GettingStartedGuide/

1. Launch the AMI
The CEServer image has all of the necessary software installed, including Nginx, rmagick, and the other required gems for CE.

  ec2-run-instances ami-XXXXX -k path/to/ec2-key

2. SSH into your instance
Once started you will be able to find the address of the instance using ec2-describe-instances and ssh in using your pubkey.

  ssh -i ~/.ec2/id_rsa-gsg-keypair root@ec2-000-000-000-000.compute-1.amazonaws.com

3. Grab the ce_setup.rb script

  cd ~
  git clone git://github.com/bborn/communityengine-setup.git
  cd communityengine-setup
  ruby ce_setup.rb

- When asked for the hostname, enter the EC2instance hostname (i.e. ec2-000-000-000-000.compute-1.amazonaws.com)
- When asked if you want to deploy, type Y to have ce_setup deploy the application to your EC2 instance, or N to skip this step.
  
NOTES:

The ce_setup.rb script creates a git repository on your EC2 instance. To modify your application, you should clone that repository and do your work locally:  

  git clone ssh://{ec2_server_hostname}/mnt/git/{application}.git
  
Take a look at config/deploy, make changes and try deploying!
  
## Using CommunityEngine-Setup locally to get CE installed

NOTE: this will not work on an existing application!

1. Grab the ce_setup.rb script and run it

  cd ~
  git clone git://github.com/bborn/communityengine-setup.git
  cd communityengine-setup
  ruby ce_setup.rb
  
- When prompted for the path where you want to store your repository, enter the absolute path to the directory where you want to keep your application (i.e. /Users/bruno/Projects)
- When asked for the hostname, enter the hostname of your production server (if you have one), just enter example.com if you don't plan on deploying yet (the hostname is used in generating the deploy recipe, and you can always change it later.)
- When asked if you want to deploy, type Y to have ce_setup deploy the application to your production server, or N to skip this step.
